This document keeps track of the 3-day development sprints at solsort.com, across different projects. The content will also be posted on the solsort blog.

# 2015-10-20 Tinkuy.dk and ClojureScript Infrastructure

This sprint I focus on tinkuy.dk and my ClojureScript infrastructure

Results:

- tinkuy.dk
  - editable profile details
  - list of public profiles
  - merged fix of issue #69, #74, and #79 into master
  - deployed to tinkuy-staging for testing
  - fix date-dependent part of blackbox-testing, was issue #30
- started looking into better DB-abstraction for cljs-apps
  - Installed LevelDB in nwjs as storage backend
  - Designed API for new version of MuBackend, http://solsort.com/2015/10/20/mubackend-revisited/
  - TODO: Trying out watching sync'ed reactive in-memory clojurescript atom for access

Tools:

- Ruby/Rails, CouchDB, ClojureScript, nw-gyp/nwjs

Starting point:

- Previousely created a similar recommendation calculation
- Have taught eigenvector analysis etc., but never applied it to problems this large before

Takeways:

- CPouchDB does not really perform / feels unnatural
- nw-gyp for native modules in node-webkit

# 2015-10-15 Library data

Preprocessed/analysed some library data, to build an app upon later on:

Results:

- Recommendations/related materials, based on similarity measure similar to cosine-similarity, but with slightly different weight for more relevant results.
- Eigenvector analysis (truncated SVD) of materials/loans, which can be used for a fast "relatedness" distance between materials (and will also be interesting to explore, to see if it can be used for a computational/empirical aproach to "genres")
- Easy to use data model (triples a la LOD) from different source, - and loaded into CouchDB
- Compressed local copy/backup of data

Tools:

- python, leveldb, gensim, couchdb

Starting point:

- Previousely created a similar recommendation calculation
- Have taught eigenvector analysis etc., but never applied it to problems this large before

Takeways:

- It is easy to run SVD on large datasets. (unlike last time I looked at it, 10 years ago). Gensim crushes large data suprisingly fast (200 main eigenvalues on a ca. 1Mx500K sparse matrix in <16GB and less than a night).
- Mahout/spark is overkill+overhead when you do not need it nor have a cluster. (Installed Cloudera/CDH, spark etc. and got started, but then realised that it was easier just to implement it in python)

# 2015-10-04 Hack4DK

Participated in the yearly danish culural heritage hackathon:

Results:

- An embeddable viewer for 360º rotational images from the collection of the National Museum, which makes it easier for people to share these rotational images.
- Semantic markup of data from Det Danske Filminstitut, which will make the data discoverable by search-engines, robots, etc.

Tools:

- ClojureScript, HTML5, re-frame/reagent/react

Starting point:

- The embeddable 360º rotational viewer was written from scratch, as I wanted to make it using/improving my primary toolbelt/tech-stack. I already knew the basics of optimising etc. 360º-rotational images, as I had worked on a similar project before.
- I have worked with semantic markup, with the danish library data. so I knew how to approach it, though I did not use any framework for generating it.

Takeaways:

- When making embeddable widget, a good idea is also to make an embed-code generator, so it is even easier for non-technical bloggers etc. to use it.
- Working with the XML-data from dfi, was super easy thanks to ClojureScript. This was a pleasant suprise, as I had not used ClojureScript for XML-processing before.
- If I continue publishing semantic data, I should make some tools to make it even easier, as I was kind-of redoing the same things, that I was doing with the library data.
